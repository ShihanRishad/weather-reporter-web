# Weather reporter Web

Previously, I created a simple python project for creating a weather report based on a location given by the input. It was my first python project, so a simple one. Here, I created a web interface for making it more user-friendly. It is still simple, because there is no authentication for saving the weather reports for each, but it is a demo which shows that it's possible. Here, the main algorithom stays the same, but there is a web interface where you can play around and get weather reports. This isn't meant be a public code, it just shows that by click of a button you are getting a weather report, which get saved into your computer (in case of a published app, saved on the server).
